      "text": "<p>Lun Hui is my MFA thesis project at Parsons School of Design. It is a platform created to drive demand for upcycling and bring city residents together. The service connects individuals who are decluttering to craftspeople who make products from recycled materials. The goal is to reduce waste and create value to fulfill customersâ€™ feelings of satisfaction, thrift, and resourcefulness.</p><p>The outcome is an artificial bot-centered up-cycling service. The bot can be embodied in different chat applications, such as Messenger and Slack. There are also separate online platforms for presenting and selling up-cycled creations, including a website, a Facebook page, and an Instagram account.</p><p>Design Questions:</p><p>Why is up-cycling a good solution for waste problems? How can we create an up-cycling loop to turn waste into new products and bring people who throw things away and craftspeople who can reuse waste into this loop? What is the best way /media /platform to connect all the things together to build up the loop? How might I make the decluttering experience as easy as throw things away and the ordering material experience as casual as pick up things along the street? Can up-cycled products be attractive, fashionable, and accepted by the majority of people?</p><p>This project is accepted to the ACM Creativity & Cognition 2017 Technology Demonstrations.</p><p><a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3059454.3078710\" target=\"_blank\">Published Paper</a></p><p><a href=\"http://caom061.github.io/res/thesispaper-lunhui.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Paper</a></p><p>Concept Development, Branding Design, UI UX Design, Visual Design.</p>",

By doing research, I visited this town and stayed at the hotel for a week to feel the culture of the place, to talk to the people living there, and to get the personality of the hotel.</p><p>The Logo and auxiliary graphs are made by woodcut print-making. The architectures in this place are mainly built with wood. Wood houses, wood bridges, wood pavilions, and wood household goods. So the craft feeling of woodcut is a right fit style. The primary color, dark blue is from Gui Cloth Dyeing. That is one of the symbols in Guizhou. Most of the residents there make a living with Gui Cloth Dyeing. You can see all the dyed fabric hanged outside of the houses. It is a unique view of this place.</p><p>The goal of this design solution is to enhance the culture of the area. People can be brought into the unique environment and get the authentic feelings by browsing the hotel website. Visitors can enjoy the consistent impressions and feel like being part of the crafts by staying at the hotel.</p><p>Branding Design, Graphic Design, Wayfinding Design.</p>",

That affected my emotions and self-confident. I could not accept myself when I was facing mirrors, which was painful. I know how hard it is to fight against skin diseases. Therefore, I want to do something for people who have the same experiences as me with my design abilities. I want to encourage everyone to accept their unperfect skins, to discover the unique behind it.
