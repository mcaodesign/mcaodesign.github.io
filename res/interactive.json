There are sensors on the device to detect heart rate, beat-to-beat variability (HRV), and how these change throughout one meditation and overtime. The data generates the user's calm & focus score during the meditation session.

We want to build an active social space for members to achieve their intentions and to fulfill their demands.</p><p>Clade has an open application process. While anyone can apply, the requirements for membership are not made available publicly, and almost all successful applicants are referred by other members. The membership selection process is overseen by our Admissions Committee. So, the onboarding/applying process became a big challenge for us. How to ask enough questions for Clade to select the right members and how to keep it simple and feel short at the same time.</p><p>Clade-Private includes many components. There are posts feed (articles, deals, philanthropy, Clade Kids, arts), writing posts, interacting with posts, investing deals, messaging, clubhouse/ member's directory, profile, notifications, and settings. Also, we have a desktop admin tool to manage the Clade app. It is a challenge to build a mobile app that can do so many things. We have to understand our users enough to provide the easiest way to achieve their goals while using the app.</p><p>My role:</p><p>We were a small team. I worked closely with the product manager, developers, and marketing team. I was the only in-house designer for three months right before and after the launch. I worked with two remote freelancers while I just started working at Clade. I worked with another Sr. UX designer after we launched the product.</p><p>I designed sections of onboarding, posting philanthropy, interacting with posts (likes & comments), messaging, creating a profile, member's directory, and forgetting passwords, shown below. The design process includes research, competitive analysis, user flowers, designs, prototyping, testing, iterations, and communicating with developers.</p><p>Research, UX Design, UI Design, Visual Design, Prototyping, Testing.</p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clade-private/id1173249090?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Store Link</a></p>",
