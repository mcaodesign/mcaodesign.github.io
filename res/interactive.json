The core device is a handheld meditation tool. It vibrates to lead users to do different breath patterns with signals on inhale, exhale, and hold. There are sensors on the device to detect heart rate, beat-to-beat variability (HRV), and how these change throughout one meditation and overtime. The data generates the user's calm & focus score during the meditation session. So people can see their report right away and get to know the progress over time.</p><p>I started work at Clade in July 2019 as a Product Designer. I redesign the Core mobile app from Beta to launch with two PMs and a meditation expert.</p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/core-meditation/id1490644270\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Store Link</a></p>",

We want to build an active social space for members to achieve their intentions and to fulfill their demands.</p><p>Clade has an open application process. While anyone can apply, the requirements for membership are not made available publicly, and almost all successful applicants are referred by other members. The membership selection process is overseen by our Admissions Committee. So, the onboarding/applying process became a big challenge for us. How to ask enough questions for Clade to select the right members and how to keep it simple and feel short at the same time.</p><p>Clade-Private includes many components. There are posts feed (articles, deals, philanthropy, Clade Kids, arts), writing posts, interacting with posts, investing deals, messaging, clubhouse/ member's directory, profile, notifications, and settings. Also, we have a desktop admin tool to manage the Clade app. It is a challenge to build a mobile app that can do so many things. We have to understand our users enough to provide the easiest way to achieve their goals while using the app.</p><p>My role:</p><p>We were a small team. I worked closely with the product manager, developers, and marketing team. I was the only in-house designer for three months right before and after the launch. I worked with two remote freelancers while I just started working at Clade. I worked with another Sr. UX designer after we launched the product.</p><p>I designed sections of onboarding, posting philanthropy, interacting with posts (likes & comments), messaging, creating a profile, member's directory, and forgetting passwords, shown below. The design process includes research, competitive analysis, user flowers, designs, prototyping, testing, iterations, and communicating with developers.</p><p>Research, UX Design, UI Design, Visual Design, Prototyping, Testing.</p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clade-private/id1173249090?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Store Link</a></p>",

      "text": "<p>Under the skin is a story-telling interactive design project about skin diseases. Users can expect to hear eight personal stories from people who have skin conditions while interacting with the installation. It's one of my school projects at Parson School of Design.</p><p>The interactive installation includes four components: hand imprints, skin pattern images, audio players, and the patients' information. When visitors interact with the hand imprint by pushing it, it will trigger the voice telling a personal story. The stories highlight positives in the patients’ lives, despite their conditions. An obstacle the patient overcame or a way that the condition had turned their lives in a positive direction. The hand imprints are from these people who have skin problems and give their stories, which can build a connection between visitors and sufferers. The media underhand imprints are real images from volunteers’ skin.</p><p>Goals/ Why am I doing this project?</p><p>I had severe acne when I was in high school. That affected my emotions and self-confidence. I could not accept myself when I was facing mirrors, which was painful. I know how hard it is to fight against skin diseases. Therefore, I want to do something for people who have the same experiences as me with my design abilities. I did a branding design for the Women’s Skin Foundation that is listed in my creative projects section. For this interactive project, I know that there are many stories behind different skin patterns, such as how skin problems affect people's daily lives, what misunderstandings people have experienced, what they have learned from it, and what makes them stronger. I want these people to speak out to express their feelings and to bring more awareness and empathy to other people. More awareness we got, the more accepted we become.</p><p>Challenges:</p><p>The most challenging part of this project is to find interviewees who want to work with me and to tell their stories. I sent messages to people with skin problems whom I discovered on Facebook and Instagram. However, I only got one person who finally became part of my project. Then I sent emails to different skin organizations. Luckily I was able to connect with the National Psoriasis Foundation. They helped me find six volunteers from their community. That surprised me and helped me to form my final plan. I would never know that there are so many people who want to help and there are so many impressing stories if I have not tried to reach out to them. I appreciate all the helps I got, and I am thankful for this experience.</p><p>The feedback I got from volunteers and the NPF community about my outcome made me more confident to design to help people and to solve problems. Getting support from people is essential for designers to make their works more valuable.</p><p>This project was published on NPFBLOG, which can be checked out here, <a href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/blog/intersection-art-and-psoriasis\" target=\"_blank\">The intersection of art and psoriasis</a>. It was also presented at the National Psoriasis Foundation Volunteer Conference 2017 in Chicago.</p><p>UX Design, Visual presentation, Storytelling.</p>",
